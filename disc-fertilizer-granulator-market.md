<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Fertilizer Granulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unpowered Disc Granulator</li><li>Powered Disc Granulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disc fertilizer granulator market comprises two main types: unpowered and powered disc granulators. Unpowered disc granulators rely on gravitational force to shape and form fertilizer pellets, often resulting in lower production capacity and efficiency. In contrast, powered disc granulators are equipped with motors that enhance the pelletizing process, allowing for greater control, faster production rates, and uniform granule sizes. Both types serve distinct agricultural needs, with powered granulators generally preferred for larger-scale operations.</p></p>
